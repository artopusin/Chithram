# Images Directory Structure

## Folder Organization

### `/portfolio`
Store all portfolio-related images here:
- `artist.jpg` - Artist profile photo
- `artwork-1.jpg` to `artwork-5.jpg` - Portfolio artwork images
- `achievement-1.jpg` to `achievement-3.jpg` - Achievement/award images
- `class-1.jpg` to `class-3.jpg` - Art class images

### `/ui`
Store UI-related images and assets here:
- Error page images (404, 500, 503)
- Logo and brand assets
- Decorative shapes and patterns

## Usage

All images are referenced in the code using relative paths:
- Portfolio images: `/images/portfolio/[filename]`
- UI images: `/images/ui/[filename]`

This structure keeps the project organized and makes it easy to manage images locally instead of relying on external CDNs.
